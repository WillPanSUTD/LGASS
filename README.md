# Sealing Nail Defect Detection System

## Project Overview

</p>


This project implements a defect detection system for automotive battery sealing nails based on graph neural networks (GNNs). It uses point cloud data to classify surface defects. The system leverages a custom graph attention mechanism for feature extraction, enabling robust detection of various defect types on metal surfaces.

### Supported Defect Types

* Burst
* Pit
* Stain
* Warpage
* Pinhole
* Other background categories

## Data Acquisition


<p align="center">
  <img src="figures/data_acqusition.png" alt="data source" width="85%">
</p>

The dataset used in this project is collected from real-world industrial production lines for automotive battery sealing nail inspection.

All point cloud data are acquired using industrial 3D vision systems deployed in controlled manufacturing environments, covering various defect types such as surface deformation, misalignment, and structural anomalies of sealing nails. The image acquisition and imaging module consists of
a Laser Profiler as a 3D scanning system (OPT-LPC20 Laser Profiler) with a mobile robotic platform and a test specimen. 
The laser profiler is configured in linear scanning mode. The system uses a blue laser stripe (wavelength 405nm) with a profile acquisition rate of 10,000 profiles per second, ensuring high fidelity on metallic reflective surfaces.
During scanning, the sealing nails were placed on a precision rotary stage to ensure uniform coverage. The scanning speed was set to 10mm/s, and each profile captured 3000 points across the horizontal axis, resulting in a lateral resolution of ~0.05mm and vertical depth accuracy of <0.01mm. All scans were manually verified for completeness and noise artifacts.The battery is mounted on the mobile robot platform, and the calibrated 3D line laser scanning camera projects laser stripes onto the sealing nail area of the battery. Through synchronized image data acquisition during planar scanning trajectories, surface data of thesealing nail specimen are obtained.The data are manually annotated following a strict quality control process to ensure labeling accuracy and consistency.

## Environment Setup

### Recommended: Use Conda

1. Create a new Conda environment:

   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   ```

2. Activate the environment:

   ```bash
   conda activate sealingnail
   ```

3. Install PyTorch with CUDA:

   ```bash
   conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=11.8 -c pytorch -c nvidia
   ```

4. Install other dependencies:

   ```bash
   conda install numpy scipy scikit-learn
   conda install -c conda-forge open3d
   conda install tqdm tensorboard h5py
   ```

5. Ensure C++/build tools (Linux):

   ```bash
   sudo apt install g++
   sudo apt install build-essential
   sudo apt install ninja-build
   ninja --version
   ```

6. Install custom pointops library:

   ```bash
   cd lib/pointops
   python setup.py install
   ```

7. Verify installation:

   ```bash
   python -c "import torch; print(torch.__version__); print(torch.cuda.is_available())"
   ```

## Dataset Structure
Data can be downloaded from:
Hugging Face Dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/vpan1226/OPT-SND
The dataset is organized as follows:

```
data/sealingNail_normal/
├── train/    # Training set
└── test/     # Test set
```

Each point cloud file contains:

* 3D coordinates (x, y, z)
* Surface features (3 channels)
* Semantic labels

---

## Model Architecture

The model adopts an encoder–decoder structure:

1. **Encoder**: Multi-layer graph attention modules with progressive downsampling
2. **Decoder**: Multi-scale feature fusion via skip connections
3. **Classification Head**: Outputs per-point semantic predictions

---

## Usage

### Train the Model

```bash
python train.py
```

Training includes:

* Data loading and preprocessing
* Class weight computation to handle imbalance
* Model checkpoint saving
* Real-time training and validation metrics

---

### Demo Inference

Run on a single sample:

```bash
python demo.py --input data/test_sample.ply --model checkpoints/best_model.pth --output results/
```

Batch inference:

```bash
python batch_demo.py --input data/test_folder/ --model checkpoints/best_model.pth --output results/
```

Visualization:

```bash
python visualize.py --ply results/labeled_cloud.ply
```

Export HTML report:

```bash
python export_report.py --input results/ --output reports/
```

## Model Evaluation

The system supports multiple evaluation metrics:

* Overall Accuracy (OA)
* Mean Accuracy (mAcc)
* Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU)
* Per-class IoU
